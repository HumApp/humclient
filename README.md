# Humm App for sharing music

Hum is an IOS application that allows users to share playlists across music streaming platforms. Our application currently supports the conversion of apple music to Spotify and vice versa.

## Motivation
### Example
Emily and her best friend Elena are always sharing their playlists. However, Emily uses apple music and Elena uses spotify. So they  currently screenshot their playlist and message it to the other person. They then have to search through their respective music streaming service for each song and add it to a playlist.
## Resolution
Now with Humm, Emily and Elena log in to our app, and connect their music screaming service. All of their playlists are imported and they add each other as friends. They then  share individual playlists with one another. Once Emily or Elena accepts the playlist request, the playlist gets downloaded to spotify or apple. The playlist shows up under their shared playlists view in our app as well as on their spotify or apple music account. With Humm you can also convert your own playlists from one service to another.

## Future Features:
- YouTube support
- Collaborative Playlists
- In-App music streaming
